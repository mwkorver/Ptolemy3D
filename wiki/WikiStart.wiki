pTolemy3D project's goal is to make it easy to put a dynamic 3D world into any web page.  It's a tool kit that includes a 3D Java applet, server side components and tools that utilize standard technologies such as Jpeg 2000, OpenGL, and OpenGIS standards such as WMS and WFS to provide a 3D earth visualization experience - which you fully control.

= Ptolemy Refoundation =

Ptolemy goal is to build a good virtual globe SDK (open source project of course), easy to use and to extend by anyone.

The current version has some serious design problems and complex code which makes difficult to understand and extend for anyone who wants to contribute.
Because this, recently Ptolemy project authors has started a period or re-foundation to build the project again from scratch.

'''The goal of re-foundation project are:
 * Use a new working methodology (more ''agile''). 
 * Improve the project documentation.
 * Make a new implementation from scratch.'''

After that, we want to have a basic Virtual Globe SDK with a good design, implementation and documentation and, of course, stable enough to be used in any production environment :)

This way contributors will present their ideas, they will be discussed (using chat, email or [http://groups.google.com/group/ptolemy3d Ptolemy group]) and finally they will be briefly documented or explained and implemented.

'''In the next link you can follow the evolution of this amazing stage of the project: [PtolemyRefoundation Ptolemy Refoundation].'''

As always you are welcome to participate actively.
