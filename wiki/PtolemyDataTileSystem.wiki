
== pTolemy3D Tile System ==

pT uses map imagery in the Platte Carr√©e projection of the WGS84 
longitude/latitude coordinates in decimal degrees (DD) with Greenwich as
the central meridian.

The SRS code is "[http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4326/ EPSG:4326]"

this allows pT to take rectangular image (2x1 ratio) and map it to a sphere.


----
In order satisfy the necessary LOD of the current view, map data is tiled and layered at successively higher resolutions.  Each higher resolution has 64x the number of tiles, forming an 8x8 grid of the previous tile.

Each tile is 1024 pixel square jp2000 file that is internally layered 4x

----

The pT coordinate system uses longitude/latitude DD values directly in the path and filename to describe both the detail level and position of each tile.
