
== pTolemy3D Server ==

pTolemy3D requires only a standard http server to show basic 3D scenes. The data on the server is a pyramid of image files and DEM files, in jp2 and bin format.  The Viewer, looks for data on the http server as function of its altitude.  This altitude-to-pyramid-level relationship is set as applet params in the html file that contains the Viewer.

Active data, such as data from other WMS and WFS servers can be rendered via the Viewer's plugin feature.
