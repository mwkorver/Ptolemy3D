DemMaker

description

this is a java program to generate .bdm and .tin files for pTolemy3D .

command

java -classpath ./js3dbatch.jar:lib/jj2000-4.1.jar:. com.aruke.batch.tool.!DemMaker [options]

options

    * -minx [float8]
    * -miny [float8]
    * -maxx [float8]
    * -maxy [float8] 


    * -tw [tile width float8]
    * -cw [cell width float8] 


    * -units [METER|DD] 


    * -prefix [2 char file prefix, ex. use japangsi zone (01 - 19) use 00 for DD tiles.] 


    * -srcdir [dir of DEM data files]
    * -out [dir to save jp2] 


    * -hdr [.hdr]      ''The ascii header file from the GRIDFLOAT output''
    * -dat [data file] ''The ESRI GRIDFLOAT Binary Grid -- used named as *.dat''


    * -isAscii         
  '''''What is -isAscii used for???'''''


    * -outputType[0|1] 0-bdm, 1-tin 


    * -innersig[double] for tin procesing, in meters number to trim data on inside of dem
    * -wallsig[double] for tin procesing, in meters number to trim data on edges of dem 


    * -divider [int] 

output

"-out (directory)" specifies where the dem files will be saved. the output is a dem data file with a georeferenced name in the format (prefix)x(upper left x)y(upper right y).jp2

Tile width

The first logical step is to decide on the tile width for the dem tiles. this number specifies how many units across the tile will be. for example if i enter "-tw 250" and I intend to use a meter coordinate set this tile will be 250 meters across and down.

lat lon data is multiplied by 1000000 to keep the values as integers. so a tile width of 0.0016 would be in directory 1600.

Cell Width

the width of each cell for each tile. to get a clean looking transfer from tile to tile divide the Tile Width by 8 and use that value. the very bottom level is more free since it does not encapsulate tiles. so if a 250m tile was my smallest layer width and I had a 50m dem, I could probably set cw to 50, even though it isn't a quotient of 250 and 8.


Bounding Box

the minx,miny,maxx,maxy parameters define the area that will be covered. the program will automatically align the tiles so they are cut in respect to a x=0,y=0 tile. this causes the tiles to always be lined up correctly.

outputType

default to 0, a regular grid .bdm file. set to 1 to output tin tiles.

tin parameters

innerSig and wallSig are numbers to decide how general or detailed to make TIN data. I usually set both to about 0.5 for a 10 meter dem. usually I will output some data, see how big the file comes out, and then make adjustments.
