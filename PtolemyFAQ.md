# Frequently Asked Questions about pTolemy3D #

[[PageOutline](PageOutline.md)]

## What is the pTolemy3D viewer? ##
pTolemy3D is an cross-platform open-source viewer that simplifies access to 3D geospatial data. As a Java applet with an javascript driven API that allows AJAX style application development it is built from the ground up to be cross browser, cross platform.

## Why would I use pTolemy3D for my mapping applications instead of Google Maps, Google Earth, or Microsoft Virtual Earth? ##
Google Maps, Google Earth, and Microsoft Virtual Earth are excellent tools. However, they are proprietary systems with complex EULAs that limit use in corporate environments. They are generally designed for consumer use, and if used professionally, require costly licensing fees. The pTolemy3D project counters these issues by not restricting how the Viewer is used and by providing basic tools for developers to "roll their own" 3D worlds.

## How will the open-source community be supported? ##
The pTolemy3D community is recognized as the most important aspect of this project. We welcome those who want to contribute to the project with logins to the trac site and after vetting from the Steering Committee, direct commit access to the repository.  We know there is a lot of talent out there.  However, please understand that we are still brand new and are working to make this process open and clear.

## Why would I use pTolemy3D for my mapping applications instead of NASA's Worldwind Java or other "open" 3D clients? ##
It could very well be that NASA's Worldwind Java (WWJ) is a better choice for your project.  We recognize that it is more mature and consider it as one of several references for improvements to pTolemy3D.  Our view is that if you are a Java developer/organization who wants to be able to make direct impact on core components of the Viewer by participating at an early stage in engineering those changes, and are more comfortable working with an open process where daily changes are reflected in the repository, then pTolemy3D is for you.

## What is SpatialCloud? ##
SpatialCloud is a geospatial Web Services provider, currently under development, that will allow users to process, host, and distribute data via an automated cloud-based service infrastructure. It is complement to pTolemy3D.org, of which SpatialCloud is the founding sponsor. Learn more by visiting http://www.SpatialCloud.com.

## Do I have to use SpatialCloud's Web Services to make pTolemy3D work? ##
No. pTolemy3D is completely independent from SpatialCloud Web Services. However, if you are planning to provide enterprise class data processing and hosting services to your clients, the SpatialCloud team hopes you will want to use their backend services so that you can concentrate on the customer application side of your project.

## Why are you making pTolemy3D open/free? ##
pTolemy3D is free for a number of reasons. SpatialCloud's business model requires access to embedded 3D viewer technology that is unencumbered by complex and costly EULAs. SpatialCloud's revenue is a function of it Web Services, not Ptolemy3D itself. We know what our business model is, we don't need to know about yours.

## Who do you expect will use pTolemy3D and SpatialCloud Web Services? ##
The intended market for pTolemy3D and SpatialCloud is the developer and content provider interested in working with open-source geospatial software. Further, some developers will be interested in SpatialCloud's Web Services. As far as possible applications of pTolemy3D and SpatialCloud Web Services, they are endless. Users may include governments, corporations, businesses, organizations, and individuals who have an interest in distributing mapping data to any number of clients. In-house developers or consultants can utilize pTolemy3D and/or SpatialCloud resources to make these applications a reality.

## Where did the name come from? ##
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy, also in the [Bartimaeus Trilogy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bartimaeus_Trilogy), one of which is titled "Ptolemy's Gate" there is character named Ptolemy that speaks to the magic of all of this stuff.
