- Inheritance design. Decide one inheritance JS method and code it (probably like OpenLayers.Class).

- Let Camera as a base class and create OrbitCamera, FlatCamera, etc subclasses which must implement
  the 'render' method.

- Put check code. Many methods makes no comprovation of the parameters (null, invalid values, ...).
  We need to add check code and throw exceptions when needed. This way developing code and found problems
  will be easy because user can use try/catch blocks and get the exceptions to know what the problem is.

- Improve shaders code. Good idea will be put code in Ptolemy namespace that allows to load shader programs
  and select which program must be used. This way renderable objects can load its own shaders and
  use them in the RenderableObject.render() method.

- Implement Animator using keyframe rate.

- Study some picking method to implement.

- Study multitexture rendering in WebGL.

- Study HTML5 cache (localStorage) to locally store downloaded tiles.
