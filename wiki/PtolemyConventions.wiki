= Ptolemy Conventions = 

This document contains (more or less) the basic conventions to be used in the Ptolemy development.

 * Use [http://yuml.me yUML] to create simple and nice class diagrams.
 * Make your attributes private and create getter/setter methods.
 * Indent and use parenthesis in a Java way:
{{{
  String name = "John";
  if(name.equals("John") {
    // TODO - Action for John
  } else {
    // TODO - Action for no John
  }
}}}
 * Write some lines on top of every method describing what it does.
 * Spent some time documenting the relations and implications among classes. We want a FOS project not only with a nice code and that includes the comments on it.
