pTolemy3D Corporate Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") v1.0<br>
<a href='http://code.google.com/p/ptolemy3d/wiki/PtolemyContributeCcla'>http://code.google.com/p/ptolemy3d/wiki/PtolemyContributeCcla</a>

Thank you for your interest in the pTolemy3D project, which is<br>
presently maintained by Spatial Cloud LLC (the "Maintainer"). In order<br>
to clarify the intellectual property license granted with<br>
Contributions from any person or entity, the Maintainer must have a<br>
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file that has been signed by<br>
each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms<br>
below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as<br>
the protection of the Maintainer and its users; it does not change<br>
your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.<br>
<br>
This version of the Agreement allows an entity (the "Corporation") to<br>
submit Contributions to the Maintainer, to authorize Contributions<br>
submitted by its designated employees to the Maintainer, and to grant<br>
copyright and patent licenses thereto.<br>
<br>
If you have not already done so, please complete and send an original<br>
signed Agreement to:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>ptolemy3D c/o Spatial Cloud LLC<br>
6221 Chancellor Drive<br>
Cedar Falls, Iowa 50613 <br>
U.S.A.<br></blockquote>

The signed Agreement may also be sent by facsimile to the Maintainer at:<br>

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your<br>
present and future Contributions submitted to the Maintainer.  In<br>
return, the Maintainer shall not use Your Contributions in a way that<br>
is contrary to the public benefit.  Except for the license granted<br>
herein to the Maintainer and recipients of software distributed by<br>
the Maintainer, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to<br>
Your Contributions.<br>
<br>
1. Definitions.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>"You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity<br>
authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement<br>
with the Maintainer. For legal entities, the entity making a<br>
Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled<br>
by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to<br>
be a single Contributor.  For the purposes of this definition,<br>
"control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the<br>
direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or<br>
otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the<br>
outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship,<br>
including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that<br>
is intentionally submitted by You to the Maintainer for inclusion<br>
in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by<br>
the Maintainer (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition,<br>
"submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written<br>
communication sent to the Maintainer or its representatives,<br>
including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing<br>
lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that<br>
are managed by, or on behalf of, the Maintainer for the purpose of<br>
discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that<br>
is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You<br>
as "Not a Contribution."</blockquote>

2. Grant of Copyright License.  Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
<blockquote>this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Maintainer and to<br>
recipients of software distributed by the Maintainer a perpetual,<br>
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,<br>
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your<br>
Contributions and such derivative works.</blockquote>

3. Grant of Patent License.  Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
<blockquote>this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Maintainer and to<br>
recipients of software distributed by the Maintainer a perpetual,<br>
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have<br>
made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the<br>
Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims<br>
licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your<br>
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s)<br>
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any<br>
entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging<br>
that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed,<br>
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any<br>
patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for<br>
that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such<br>
litigation is filed.</blockquote>

4. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above<br>
<blockquote>license. You represent further that each employee of the<br>
Corporation designated on Schedule A below (or in a subsequent<br>
written modification to that Schedule) is authorized to submit<br>
Contributions on behalf of the Corporation.</blockquote>

5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original<br>
<blockquote>creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others).  You<br>
represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete<br>
details of any third-party license or other restriction (including,<br>
but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you<br>
are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your<br>
Contributions.</blockquote>

6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions,<br>
<blockquote>except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide<br>
support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by<br>
applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your<br>
Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS<br>
OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without<br>
limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,<br>
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.</blockquote>

<blockquote>7. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation,<br>
<blockquote>You may submit it to the Foundation separately from any<br>
Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and<br>
of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited<br>
to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which<br>
you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as<br>
"Submitted on behalf of a third-party: <a href='named.md'>here</a>".</blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote>8. It is your responsibility to notify the Maintainer when any change<br>
<blockquote>is required to the list of designated employees authorized to<br>
submit Contributions on behalf of the Corporation, or to the<br>
Corporation's Point of Contact with the Maintainer.</blockquote></blockquote>
